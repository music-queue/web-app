# Music-Queue-Ap

Link to MuQueue: http://muqueue.appspot.com/

Purpose of the app:

Have you ever gone to an event, whether it is a party at some club or one of your friends' place but the music played by the DJ is not at your taste?
MuQueue app provides a platform for the event organizers and the partyers. Organizers can create an event post which will be open for a period of time and during that period of time, partyers can vote for music that they wish to hear at the events.

Currently the events are static data and when the users search for musics, we have implemented a list in the backend so as to get results back from our search.


Some Future plans are:
- Create a database for organizers when they sign up. By having an account, they can easily create new posts and view the results
- Connect the app to a music API for e.g Spotify API where the users can search for different kind of musics
- Use Google map API to give directions of those events around the user
- Implemenent search for events
